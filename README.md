NO NEW FEATURES will be added to this branch via public pull requests. "Branding" has been changed for the _**FINAL**_ time to be project neutral. No more dsp or tpz.~~ _deprecated, the core devs are working out of the base stable branch now_

If the community feels a change is mature enough to go into this branch, they can bring it to our attention to be merged here. _This branch will be renamed to `base` in the upcoming move._

 * [Freedom](https://github.com/DerpyProjectGroup/topaz/tree/freedom) : this branch, anyone can PR anything to. If enough people approve it, it will get merged. **Anyone can review. All the things will land here, but base your PRs off the other branch please!** _This branch will be renamed to `everything` in the upcoming move._

Pull Requests should **not** target the info or topaz branch. I recommend basing your work on the community maintained "stable branch".


## Mini-FAQ
Q: Will you review my PR Teo? Does this mean Teo is developer again? Or Lead developer?

A: No, No, and oh hell no. The most I will do for the freedom branch is check the reviews others have left. If a merged PR broke something, someone will have to PR a fix or PR a revert. Github makes this easy. https://github.blog/2014-06-24-introducing-the-revert-button/

Q: What standards do reviewers hold PRs to?

A: All code styling requirements from Topaz-Next are still valid, but if reviewers miss things its "Not Teo's problem".

Q: I need help! Is there anywhere I can ask questions besides the github issues?

A: https://discord.gg/6EWFPxkZja

Q: So..no discord then?

A: not at this time, no. I hope to use Github's [discussions](https://github.com/DerpyProjectGroup/topaz/discussions) feature for anything outside teh scope of bugreporting for now. This may change in the future.

Q: Gimme a staff role! I can help!

A: You can help on 99% of things without any special roles. Things aren't gated much. But if I see you regularly being helpful, you will likely get a role to facilitate additional helping.
